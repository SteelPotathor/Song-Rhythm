# Rhythm Analysis for Yeti Jam

This project provides a rhythm analysis script specifically designed to support **Yeti Jam** on the Godot engine. The script processes an audio file to detect significant beat or rhythm changes, allowing for precise timing of music note spawns in sync with the rhythm. The output is saved in a JSON file, which can be directly integrated into Yeti Jam to achieve dynamic, music-driven gameplay.

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python Rhythm.py --audio <path_to_audio_file> --output <path_to_json_file>
